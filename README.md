# What Three Words Recorder

#### Thought i'd give it a go, even though W3W's app does the same thing.

## What does this do?
Simply allows you to browse, search and save locations with W3W, using Google Maps.
Browse; swipe around the map and look at locations.
Search; enter three words, find and get directions to that location.
Save; your current (gps enabled) or a location you've found via the map - this can be saved for a later date or shared.
